## Single-cell Contrastive Omics for Optimized Learning


- test for unpaired --> Done --> Con-AAE for SHARE is still running.
- MedR for PBMC and plots --> Done
- MedR for unpaired CITE --> Still running
- Lab report for unpaired test --> Done
- test ASW original --> Still running --> Grouped bar plots --> Dones

To Dos:
- Shuffle all data regardless of cell types to see the robustness of test unpaired --> For PBMC
- Run MedR for unpaired SHARE
- Extreme unapired setting + OT

I think I was cooked. I saved the temp checking of unpaired test to the test_unpaired dir for the PBMC data
:'(. Thanks god, I have the plots for test_unapired PBMC in lab computer. AE embs are intacted.
