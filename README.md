## Single-cell Contrastive Omics for Optimized Learning


- test for unpaired --> Done --> Con-AAE for SHARE is still running.
- MedR for PBMC and plots --> Done
- MedR for unpaired CITE --> Still running
- Lab report for unpaired test --> Done
- test ASW original --> Still running --> Grouped bar plots

To Dos:
- Shuffle all data regardless of cell types to see the robustness of test unpaired.
- Plots of unpaired CITE MedR
- Run MedR for unpaired SHARE
- Check results for test ASW original
- Extreme unapired setting + OT
