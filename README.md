## Single-cell Contrastive Omics for Optimized Learning

### To Do:

    - Add ASW plot for each dataset to the manuscript
    - Graphical Abstract
    - Recall@k from RNA -> ATAC
    - UMAP or tSNE on embeddings
    - ASW on original data, PCA-transformed data (joint and only), and joint embeddings
    - Random shuffling of same cell type from another modality --> Compute recall@k --> If good, good for unpaired.
